                    <li><strong>1934</strong> - Awarded first-class honours in mathematics.</li>
                    <li><strong>1935</strong> - Elected a Fellow of King's College due to a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.</li>
                    <li><strong>1938</strong> - Obtains his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University.</li>
                    <li><strong>1938</strong> - Begins working part-time at the GC&CS (now GCHQ). With Dilly Knox, Turing focused on cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher machine used by Nazi Germany.</li>
                    <li><strong>1939</strong> - Turing reports to Bletchley Park, GC&CS's wartime station, the day after UK had declared war on Germany. </li>
                    <li><strong>1939</strong> - Designs the "bombe", an electro-mechanical device that would go on to help decipher many encrypted German messages made using the enigma machine.</li>
                    <li><strong>1941</strong> - Proposes to colleague Joan Clarke, but after admitting to her his homosexuality, decides he could not go through with the marriage.</li>
